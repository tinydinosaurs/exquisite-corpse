# Exquisite Corpse

## Join the story

Everyone struggles with writing at some point. Sitting down in front of a blank page can be daunting to even the most prolific wordsmith. I'm struggling to write this desription right now. Writing is incredibly personal, whether it is creative, academic, or journalistic. When we write we reveal both who we are and who we want to be.

Over the years I've had many people tell me that they can't write. I have always believed they can. I believe anyone can write, sometimes we just need a starting point. The Exquisite Corpse app creates that starting point -- it gives writers a chance to share the experience of writing, to start with a page that is not blank. 

The Exquisite Corpse app is inspired by and borrows its name from a game played by Surrealists artists. Participants contribute, in turn, to a written work but are only shown the last few lines of text written by the previous collaborator. The name is derived from a line in one of the Surrealists' first such projects: *Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau* ("The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine").

Stories created collaboratively are often surprising and strange. Anyone is welcome to read the completed Exquisite Corpse stories for enjoyment or inspiration. Registered users can begin, continue, or -- depending on how many people have already contributed -- end a story. 

Anyone is welcome to participate, so sign up and join a story now!
